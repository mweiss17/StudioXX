	<h1>Claire Gallant CV</h1>
	<h4>Web Alias Laura Glass</h4>
	<h2>Applying for the web developing internship at <a href="http://www.studioxx.com"><i>  Studio XX</i></a></h2>
	<br>
	<h3>Why I would love to be your web intern</h3>
	<p>I have been learning the basics of web developing on my own over the last year and a half. I thought I would apply in comic book and web-form to demonstrate to you some of the things I have learnt and, well, what I'm all about.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><ul>
		<li><h3>Arts</h3></li>
		<p>I am a <b>graduate of Fine Arts</b> from Mount Allison University in New Brunswick. While there, I worked moslty on installation, sculpture, performance and painting. I participated in the <b>Ok.Quoi?! Contemporary Festival</b>, and worked at <b>Struts Gallery and Faucet Media Arts Centre</b>, an artist-run center. I also worked as Events Coordinator for the <b>Fredericton Arts Alliance</b>, managing their artist residency program and fundraising events. I was on the board of directors for Struts and also co-founded, wrote for and edited the <b>Sackville Arts Magazine</b>.</p>
		<li><h3>Porn for women</h3></li>
		<p>I am currently employed at a web-developing company, which mainly produces mainstream porn. I am working in <b>Multimedia</b> as a <b>photo editor</b> alongside video editors. Being a <b>sex-positive feminist</b>, I have had lots of time to reflect critically on our content and medium: pornography. I don't believe that the medium itself is the problem, or even the intentions of many mainstream pornographers. Instead, it is the lack of diversity in the content and its assumed audience: Most porn is made with the assumption that it is intended for men, and so does not reflect the wants, desires of women, and often is downright disrespectful and degrading. <b>It's because of this belief, that if more porn were intended for women, that not only would it better the industry, but it would also create a better cultural environment for women's sexualities, that I have started directing and shooting my own porn, my way.</b> After all, what better way to change a conversation than to start to talk? If porn were more inclusive of a female audience, it would foster not only mildly acceptable manifestations of female sexuality -at best- but actually "good enough to pay for" results. It was looking for equipment and a facility to edit my footage that I came upon your call for a developer intern. Working for you would give me invaluable tools in my further entrepreneurial endeavours, helping me direct, promote and distribute my own feminist porn content or the content of the talented mentors I hope to work for in the near future. 
		<br><br>Regardless of this job, if you would ever be interested in my hosting of a <b>workshop on porn for women</b>, I would love to share my acquired expertise and enthusiasm on the subject with any curious participants. <br><br>

I have been learning the basics of web developing since a year and a half now, through friends, web courses, books and videos. A founding member of HatchLabs Montreal.
